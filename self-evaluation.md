- How confident do you feel with the content of arrays so far?

I feel very confident with the content on arrays so far. All concepts that were presented were very intuitive, and I look forward to playing with arrays.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I would love to see how many arrays from the Ruby Documentation I could test and make work, but unfortunately I am under a time crunch and need to move on. I will return.

- What questions do you have about arrays?

My main questions surrounding arrays are all about "How do you do xyz with an array" which I'm assuming will be answered by looking at the ruby documentation, playing around with code, and googling if I have further difficulties.
